Adding remote repository for remote pushing to server -
1. Add the remote repository via the link 'ssh://root@45.55.241.68/var/repo/hourwise.git' if you have your ssh key set up or 'http://root@45.55.241.68/var/repo/hourwise.git' if you do not
	- Use 'git remote add (name you'd like to call it) (url)' to add a remote repo
2. Now you can push the master branch to the server via the command 'git push (name you called the remote repo)'


Geeting secure shell access to the server - 
1. Use the command 'ssh root@www.hourwise.com' to ssh into the server.
	- If you haven't added an ssh key to DigitalOcean, you can use the password 'hourwise7X3Y42'
2. Once you have ssh access, you can restart the sailsjs processes with the command 'pm2 restart all'
	- A restart is needed after pushing a code change in order for it to take effect
